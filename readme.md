# CMSG Technical Assessment

## Intro

This repository contains my submission for the CMSG Technical Assessment. The task involved bringing an e-commerce platform up to MVP by fixing bugs and implementing features
## Completed Work

### Feature Tickets

1. Basket Persistence Between Page Loads
	- Implemented localStorage to maintain basket state across browser sessions
2. Responsive Basket Menu
3. Menu Item Hover Effects
4. Menu Item Categories
5. Delivery Fee Implementation
6. Basket Item Grouping with Quantity Display
7. Code Coverage Improvement
	- Validated all implemented features and bug fixes with manual testing
	*In a production environment, I would prioritize building automated test coverage.*

### Bug Tickets

1. Menu Items Not Displayed in Price Order
2. Chocolate Cake Description Not Showing
3. Missing Currency Symbol in Basket
4. Incorrect Basket Total Calculation

### Bug Tickets - Not Addressed

Cross-Tab Basket Synchronization
- This is an edge case, Most users shop in a single tab.
Can be addressed later if the feature is really needed.
